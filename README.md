# Do Libraries Contribute to their Dependencies? A Network Analysis
This is an appendix package for the submitted manuscript for the Software Quality Journal, titled: Do Libraries Contribute to their Dependencies? A Network Analysis. This appendix consisting of experiment's raw data, including the visualization of results, and coding used.

## Abstract

Software libraries grants software projects access to a multitude of functionalities adopted as third-party dependencies. 
These packages are known to share a familiar environment and co-evolve together to form an ecosystem.
The success of Open Source has always been relying on contributions.
In this paper, we analyse the extent by which these dependency networks contribute through building network graphs. 
We collected 22,026 library projects and 5,992 developers from the Maven and RubyGems ecosystem to construct contribute and dependency network graphs.
Our results show evidence that libraries do contribute to each other within the library ecosystem.
Furthermore, we find that the older packages are significantly correlated with having high contributions within the ecosystem.
This work motivates to need for more focus how these library ecosystems support themselves.
